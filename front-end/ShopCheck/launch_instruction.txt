Make sure you have NodeJS installed, so that npm can be used.

Note: if you're currently using WSL, you need to use powershell. 
There's an issue with the Windows & Linux communication layer that causes network issues from expo-cli.

First, in bash/powershell, run sudo npm install -g expo-cli
Next, move into the front-end\ShopCheck folder and run npm ci
Finally, run npm start. 
    If you're getting the issue where "'expo' is not recognized as an internal..." on powershell,
    then run setx path "%path%;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm" and relaunch powershell.


    Otherwise, this will launch a separate localhost:19002 webpage that has the Expo DevTools.
        You have 3 choices: 
            (1) run it on an emulator for Android/iOS
            (2) run it in browser
            (3) Install Expo onto your device, scan the QR Code that's displayed, this will launch the app on your phone.
